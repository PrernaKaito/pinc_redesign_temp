            <p>All processing or use of your personal information is justified by a "lawful basis" for processing. In

            <ul>
              <li>the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, or to take
                steps (at your request) to enter into a contract (e.g. where we help an employer to fulfill an
                obligation to you under an employment contract in relation to the delivery of employee benefits);</li>
              <li>the processing is necessary for us to comply with a relevant legal obligation (e.g. where we are
                required to collect certain information about our clients for tax or accounting purposes, or where we
                are required to make disclosures to courts or regulators); or</li>
              <li>
                the processing is in our legitimate commercial interests, subject to your interests and fundamental
                rights(e.g. where we use personal information provided to us by our clients to deliver our services, and
                that processing is not necessary in relation to a contract to which you are a party).
                <br />
                In limited circumstances, we will use your consent as the basis for processing your personal
                information, for example, where we are required to obtain your prior consent in order to send you
                marketing communications.

              </li>
